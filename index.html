                                    I always learn tools that have a high likelihood of being used in the future. It is beneficial to consider programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and knowledge as tools that will make life easier, particularly for web developers. Rather than memorizing syntax, I concentrate on learning the fundamentals or concepts.

                        Hi! My name is Edgar, and I have a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. Since early 2020, I've been working in the web development industry for <span id="date-counter"></span>+ years now. I built several websites but only included a few in my website portfolio. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I graduated from college in 2013 as an IT student. I attempted to pursue a programming career immediately after
                    graduation and even received an interview invitation. Unfortunately, I was unable to do so at the time. A variety of
                    factors, including the environment, and the cost of my trip to Manila. That was understandable
                    given my humble upbringing. </p>
                    
                    <p>As a result, my first job was as a cashier at a gas station three towns away from home.
                    I work 12 hour shifts six days a week and 24 hour shifts twice a month. I was 19 at the time and said yes to everything;
                    things were not easy and it is not a fulfilling job either. I moved from one job to another that was not in the technology industry. </p>

                    <p>The Covid 19 pandemic struck hard in early
                    2020, and I was laid off as a result. In my spare time, I attempted to re-learn web development, and it came naturally
                    to me. I freelance using my current skills to keep myself afloat while looking for a web developer job.</p>
                    <p>
                    If you are looking for a Frontend Developer, please let me know how I can assist, and I hope you would then join me on
                    my journey.
                    </p>
